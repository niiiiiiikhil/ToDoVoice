# ToDoVoice 🧠🎤

ToDoVoice is a simple web app where you can **control your to-do list using your voice**.  
You can speak natural commands like:

- “I need to finish homework”
- “Delete task 2”
- “Mark task 1 as done”
- “Clear everything”

The app listens, updates your task list, and even **talks back** to confirm what it did.
